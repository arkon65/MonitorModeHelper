# Proper Monitor Mode Script
Monitor mode script for Linux systems with the aim to set supported WiFi cards into monnitor mode. 

In order to return the interface into managed mode, I have developed a network restart script as well.

Instructions for both scripts are available in each file.

Thank you <3
